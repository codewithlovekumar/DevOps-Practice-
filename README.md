📢 Starting My 90-Day DevOps Journey 🚀
Today marks the beginning of my 90-day DevOps learning journey, where I will practice, learn, and share my progress daily on LinkedIn. 🎯
As a self-motivated learner, I am committed to mastering:
 ✅ Linux & Shell Scripting 🐧
 ✅ Networking & Security 🌐
 ✅ CI/CD Pipelines & Automation ⚙️
 ✅ Docker, Kubernetes & Cloud ☁️
 ✅ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible) 🏗️
 ✅ Monitoring & Logging 📊
Why am I sharing this?
 🔹 To stay accountable.
 🔹 To document my growth.
 🔹 To connect with industry experts.
 🔹 To seek valuable insights, resources, and opportunities.
I need your support! 🙌
 If you have any advice, resources, project ideas, or internship/job opportunities, I would deeply appreciate your guidance. Your support means a lot to me!
I respect and value everyone who helps me in this journey. Let’s connect, learn, and grow together! 🚀
Follow my progress daily! I will also push everything to GitHub so that anyone can follow along.
