### **🛠 Hands-on Exercises & Tasks**

#### **🔹 Task 1: User Management & Permissions**
1️⃣ Check the current user:
   ```bash
   whoami
   sudo whoami
   ```
2️⃣ Create a new user and set a password:
   ```bash
   sudo useradd devops_user
   sudo passwd devops_user
   ```
3️⃣ Switch to the new user:
   ```bash
   su - devops_user
   ```

#### **🔹 Task 2: File & Directory Management**
1️⃣ Navigate to `/tmp` and create a directory:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   mkdir devops_practice
   ```
2️⃣ Create multiple files inside the directory:
   ```bash
   touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   ```
3️⃣ Copy a file to a backup folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir backup
   cp file1.txt backup/
   ```
4️⃣ Rename and move a file:
   ```bash
   mv file2.txt renamed_file.txt
   ```
5️⃣ Delete a file and restore it using `cp`:
   ```bash
   rm renamed_file.txt
   cp backup/file1.txt renamed_file.txt
   ```

#### **🔹 Task 3: Disk & Storage Operations**
1️⃣ Check available disk space:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
2️⃣ List block storage devices:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
3️⃣ Show partition details:
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,FSTYPE
   ```
4️⃣ Display all mounted file systems:
   ```bash
   mount | column -t
   ```

#### **🔹 Task 4: File Content Operations**
1️⃣ Create a file and add text:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, DevOps!" > sample.txt
   ```
2️⃣ Display file content:
   ```bash
   cat sample.txt
   ```
3️⃣ Append text to an existing file:
   ```bash
   echo "Welcome to Linux Practice." >> sample.txt
   ```
4️⃣ Display the first and last lines of the file:
   ```bash
   head -n 2 sample.txt
   tail -n 1 sample.txt
   ```

#### **🔹 Task 5: Bonus Challenges**
1️⃣ **Create multiple directories and files using a loop:**
   ```bash
   for i in {1..5}; do
     mkdir "dir$i"
     echo "Hello DevOps!" > "dir$i/file$i.txt"
   done
   ```
2️⃣ **Find all `.txt` files in `/tmp/devops_practice/` and display their content:**
   ```bash
   find /tmp/devops_practice -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \;
   ```
